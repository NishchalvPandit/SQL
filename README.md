# Databases and SQL

A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. It is designed to efficiently manage, store, retrieve, and update large amounts of structured information.

Databases are used in various applications and industries to store and manipulate data in a structured manner, allowing for easy access, retrieval, and analysis of information.

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns, and establishes relationships between the tables.

In a relational database, data is stored in tables, which are structured as two-dimensional grids.


## SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a set of commands and syntax for querying, updating, and managing the data stored in a relational database.
## DML
DML (Data Manipulation Language): It is used to manipulate the data stored in the database.
